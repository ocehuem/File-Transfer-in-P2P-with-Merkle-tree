In Merkle_tree.ipynb give a file with name file.txt
It can perform
1)division of file into chunks each of size 1024
2)Building the merle tree using hashes and can access at each level
3)Encrypting and decrypting a chunk

# Merkle Tree File Processing

In `Merkle_tree.ipynb`, you can use a file named `file.txt` for the following operations:

1. **Division of File into Chunks**: The file will be divided into chunks, each of size 1024 bytes.
2. **Building the Merkle Tree**: The Merkle tree is built using hashes of the file chunks. You can access the tree at each level.
3. **Encrypting and Decrypting a Chunk**: The chunks can be encrypted and decrypted using AES encryption, making it suitable for secure file transfers.
